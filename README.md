# 2D Robotic drawing arm

## Background
Robotic arms are used in many applications in today’s society. Nowadays, the possibilities of controlling and building robotics arms are increasing. Robotic arms are
capable of accomplishing human arm tasks more precisely and faster. For this reason they are used in a widely spectra of modern industry, to increase the efficiency
of the production in different ways.

>The purpose with this project is to create a 3-dof robotic arm that can be fed with a picture to draw on a paper.

## Problem formulation
To reach the goal, the following problems are handled:
• Designing and building a 3-dof drawing robot arm
• Moving the arm to a desired position
• Defining algorithms for processing a picture to feed the robot

## Scope
This project is performed within a period of less than two months provided by Robotics club of IIT Guwahati to showcase in the Technical fest. Due to this, there are limitations in both time and budget for making the project. The construction is therefore limited to the available resources.
A lot of time during the project is invested in studying the techniques, theory, designing hardware and
programming to be able to construct and control a robotic arm.

When modeling the robot arm, the friction, the inductance and external torque
is neglected to simplify the control and avoid complicated models.

## What this repository contains
2d Robotic Drawing Machine Node processing of image and Arduino Code .
This code initialises and continuously supplies an array of order of coordinates and their position in the form of pyserial to be read by arduino which would be used to run the motos of two arms of robotic drawing machine
